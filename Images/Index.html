    <h2><li>A New Age</li></h2>
    <h3><i>Start Date: Brussender 14th: Yulisen</i></h3>
    <p>The party starts in the Black Dahlia, the tavern on the east side of the city, hanging off the edge of the cliff above the shady and packed ports below, with the large opaque window forming the dahlia on the eastern side of the shattered isle, creating an opalescent lighthouse for the night merchants</p>
    <p>The merchants during the night singing their comforting sea shanties that echo through the rooms of the black dahlia making the sailors more of a community rather than separating them. </p>
    <p>They met delilah the bar owner, the tiefling and Mardson the kind of american talking sailour who told them of the undead rising in Craite, giving them the contact sent around the neighbouring cities from the Drunin family from Craite, seeking fighters and healers a like to aid them. He spoke of the uncovered tomb in Craite as well as helping Lilth with her lost ship, The Medallion, saying it was headed to a island called Chult follwed by a smaller ship, The Widows Wail, a small balck vessel similar to a scouting ship, Written in silver on the side is the name the widows wail.</p>
    <p>They spent the night getting to know each other a bit better and with Monty, Lilith and Viktor sleeping in the inn portion of the black dhalia while Val camped out underthe willow tree that overlooks the eastern sea, with Kira nestling in above under the dappled moonlight.</p>
    <p>They also learned from Marsdon that the local doctor, Johannson, had been brought to Craite to help out with the undead and figure out what was causing it.</p>
    <p>The next morning digging into a platter of Breakfast foods in the dhalia they set off to the port, lead by Delilah, who took them down the trap door to the left of the window and down the very rickity stairway, showing them the rather illegal use of merchant practice and the rigged, heading on to the port they met Captain Balthasar of the ship The Impresario.A beautiful naval ship turned merchant vessel, a red cedarwood, trimmed with copper and a large ram on the front, carrying mostly furniture (stuffed with illegal valuables that no one found). The captain granted them free passage for work on the ship, as well as telling Lilith more about the Widows Wail that was docked there not 3 moons ago, a pure black smaller ship without a crew but the ropes are intertwined with a weird tubing contains a strange viscous red liquid, no captain was in sight but when viktor walked past he felt something from it, almost a life force, and was weirdly drawn to it.</p>
    <p>When they arrived at the dock at Craite, smaller dock than dahlias but still big and packed, while the guards (dressed in black armour with silver and gold trimmings) searched the ship and cleared for trading. Once off they headed in towards the large Crevice that splits upwards in the cliff face, where it would be dark these magically lit lanterns hang from the ceiling shedding light around, inside a very busy merchant street, full of races of all kinds bartering and auctions and many stalls with all kinds of weapons , trinkets, food and jewels, as they split up, monty went to get some food trying some weird smoked fish and some fried bugs, Val having a flute off and battling musically with another pan flute player across the cavern, Lilith went a messed around with some auctions and kira followed and viktor wandered around. Until Kira saw something, a marketplace with black shawls with a porcelain face appearing behind it before it quickly disappeared, she was drawn in and met the drow that sat clamly before her showing her a series of items, a fancy sacrifical dagger, some gemmed chokers, some gemmed necklaces, a fancy set of tarot cards, and a set of cards that she was interested in, he took them forth and showed them to her, explaining they were similar to gambit cards, he offered her a contact which she rejected and ran to find lilith for some advice on it, the drow then appeared in 3 different locations to kira, lilith and Viktor, managing to get a deal from Viktor and Kira but not Lilith.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><h4><i><u>Viktors Deal</u></i></h4></li>
        <p><i><u>Information for Information</u></i><br> He signed the contract that would give him all the drows information on the book of hemomancy he owns and in return the drow would be able to see any information in Viktors head in the future. </p>
        <li><h4><i><u>Kiras Deal</u></i></h4></li>
        <p><i><u>The deck of cards</u></i><br> 1d4 force damage and the chance to knock the enemy back, they rejuvenate after a while as well. In return the drow can summon the party to him 3 times.</p>
        <li><h4><i><u>Liliths Deal</u></i></h4></li>
        <p><i><u>Secret Unknown</u></i><br> She was offered 3 scrolls, the blueprints of theons guns. In return the one that was hunting her would know her location at all times She refused and said she would find the scrolls another way and threatened the drow </p>
        <li><h4><i><u>Viktors second deal</u></i></h4></li>
        <p><i><u>The Phylactery</u></i><br> He would be able to store part of his soul in the glass box trimmed with brass so if he died he could be brought back, however he would have to release whatever is already in the box In return the drow would have full control over his soul, he would be in ownership of it and could do with it what he wants. </p>
    </ul>
    <p>Monty also met Jessamine, the tiefling rogue, dressed in black with a silver sash/line across his midrift, with a small silver k on her collar. Her armour coming across like a double breasted coat, her colour is green fading lighter as it reaches her neck and above. Her left horn is larger curving down across her collar bones and her right spiraling up like a corkscrew. She told Monty about the Krieg family being in charge of the theives guild and the masters of information, and that the Drunin being in charge of the other houses and the miltary in Craite. She also saw something in the crowd that made her worried and she said shit and darted off into the shadows. </p>
    <p>After all of this they moved to the surface, heading west towards Craite, heading through the caverns with the strobing blue crystals in the walls, taking about 50 minutes to get there they found themselves in the main street, with smooth clean paving stones, strong man made brick buildings line the streets, with large amounts of blacksmiths around the area, one being a very large smelter with a half moon of different blacksmiths with the smelter connected to each and each specialising in something. </p>
    <p>The exit of the cavern was just to the left of the Drunin estate. </p>
    <p>They then saw the houses, The Large Cathedral like home of the Drunin family at the base of the mountain much larger than the other estates, to the west the Krieg Family, high up built into the mountain the Krieg having two braziers spouting lava from them as it cascades down the bannisters on either side of the long stairway, the mahogany doors sit solid and closed, above it reads <i><b>STAY VIGILANT</b></i> in Dwarvish.  </p>
    <p>On the Right side there is the Brun Family, Home to the protectors of the city, the guards of the walls, worshippers of the old god <i><u>HELM</u></i>, two large statues of him stand guard over the estate, on either side of the stairway up, similar to the Krieg house with lave running down the bannisters, the left most statue however has a series of scars and cuts across it, whereas the right stands strong and untarnished. Helm is known as the vigilant one and the watcher.</p>
    <p>They headed to Kriegs house and knocked and before the door opened we ended the session.  </p>

    <h2><li>Passage to the Tomb</li></h2>
    <h3><i>Start Date: Brussender 15th (midday) (Artisan's Faire) Da'leysen </i></h3>
    <p>The session started with The party entering the stone dwarven manor of Krieg. Following the small stone clay dwarf golem inside they passed various tapestries on the wall of the different sigils of the Dwarven Houses (Below). Whilst walking down the corridor, Kira noticed a platinum helm sitting on a stand. </p>
    <ul>
        <li><h4><i><u>Branach</u></i></h4></li>
        <p>The masters of merchant trade in the city of Craite, their sigil is a wooden with a Brass B, sits at the south east side of the city</p>
        <li><h4><i><u>Krieg</u></i></h4></li>
        <p>The masters of knowledge and guilds within the city, sigil is a silver circle with a large black shadow on it, sits on the north east side of the city close to the Hammer Head In</p>
        <li><h4><i><u>Druinin</u></i></h4></li>
        <p>The main house in charge of military and oversees the city, sigil is a copper shield with an oynx hammer, sits in the centre of the northmost part of the city, the only entrance in and out of the mountain</p>
        <li><h4><i><u>Brun</u></i></h4></li>
        <p>The paladin force within the city, followers and devotees to the paladin god Helm, the watcher of the city, the manor of helm stands on the north west side of the city</p>
        <li><h4><i><u>Lutair</u></i></h4></li>
        <p>The lesser of the noble houses, almost extinct, they don't own any part of the city now, no activity has been seen inside the house for many years and it stands somewhat derelict on the south west side of the city</p>
    </ul>
    <p>Once headed down the corridor they entered the main chamber in the Krieg Manor, finding a large grandeous stairway to a throne, shaped like an actual sized sphinx. On the throne sat the figure of a larger dwarf, shrouded in shadow, his figure seeming almost like a shadow itself. After the party briefly spoke to him about a meeting with the head of the Druinin family, he said he needed to make sure they were worthy of the meeting, bringing out his stone golem, carved into the huge visage of Helm. </p>
    <p>Rising from the Large pit in the centre of the room the battle commenced with Kira landing the final blow with an acid arrow to the right eye, while Monty's sword stayed plunged into the left. During the fight a few of the members noticed that as the golems eyes changed from grey to deep hues of red and hues of green the shadowy dwarves eyes changed as well. Viktor also noticed that the image of the large stone helm bowed over with the green acid dripping from the eyes reminded him of the vison he had from the Drow. </p>
    <p>After this they spoke briefly with each member about information that they needed; 
        <ul>
            <li><h4><i><u>Kira</u></i></h4></li>
            <p>He told her of an ancient burial site on top of the Ujyt Peaks, that has been recently disturbed. </p>
            <li><h4><i><u>Lilith</u></i></h4></li>
            <p>Asked about the Widows Wail but he hadnt seen anything in the city but said to talk to Jessamine </p>
            <li><h4><i><u>Val</u></i></h4></li>
            <p>Didnt ask anything</p>
            <li><h4><i><u>Monty</u></i></h4></li>
            <p>Only asked about the undead presence</p>
            <li><h4><i><u>Victor</u></i></h4></li>
            <p>Asked about the raven queen worship in the city, there isn't a lot of worship of gods in the city apart from Helm</p>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Monty and Lilith then went to talk to Jessamine, the tiefling Monty had spoken to before in the docks of Craite. She told Lilith of the Widows Wail, that it had been docked in Craite maybe 3 weeks ago, she hadn't seen a crew but she did see a veiled woman on the ship. She didn't speak to anyone as she had her own business to attend to.  </p>
    <p>Lilith also said Jessamine and Monty were cute together and Jessamine flirted a bit before Monty ran away. </p>
    <p>In the mean time Kira went to look at the Helm she saw before, the platinum one in the hallway, placing her hand upon it and meditating she found something uneasy about it, as she stood there a voice spoke to her inside her head, "I see you" as two green eyes appeared in the helm before disappearing, as she spoke to Viktor about what was happening, he also tried to detect what was wrong with it, as he found he did feel like something was watching him he didnt see anything, Kira however noticed that the eyes appeared again to her before disappearing as laughter filled her head. </p>
    <p>As the dwarf said that he knew how to get them a meeting, and would be in contact, as they left the city they were told previously by Jessamine that they could stay at the Hammer Head, a larger well known tavern in the city perched within the mountain face, an old relic of a mountain giant battle. Travelling through the city they made their way to around seeing red banners being hung up and pop up stands being put up, seeing some dwarves tying their beards together and holding hands, others handing out small carved hearts or flowers to passer-by's, Lilith threw many of these on the ground and Kira would follow up by cheering people up and giving them flowers. </p>
    <p>They made their way to a small town square, surrounded by small houses and shops, in the centre there was a multitude of shops, one of which being a large roughly shaped heart with a hole in the middle and a larger dwarven woman with a big moustache and patches of hair, Lilith tricked Kira into saying it was a fortune teller instead in Dwarvish it read Kissing Stand, Kira stepped forward and handed her a gold piece to which she was kissed rather roughly, before Monty dragged her away like a concerned parent, they then headed to another stand, a larger, garish stand with silk drapery and large plumes of candy floss protruding from it, at it stood a tall half elf, tan skin with long black hair tied back into a braided ponytail with numerous brass bands and jewellery tied within it. Two pieces of hair fall down before his ears, as he looks on with sharp yet warm eyes and a keen smile. His arms outstretched to the crowds with his fingers covered in numerous rings, his long flowing robes of purple hues flow about him as he gestures excitedly to the party about the sweets and accoutrements that he has available, Monty orders 6 candy floss plumes and he makes them with a wave of his hand, as well as showing off some of his others items, 5 vials of potions;
        <ul>
            <li><u><i>Potion of Luck</i></u> - A see through clear liquid </li>
            <li><u><i>Potion of Waterbreathing</i></u> - A darker potion with clear bubbles moving up and down in them like a lava lamp</li>
            <li><u><i>Potion of Dragon Breathe</i></u> - A green potion with licks of orange flame in it</li>
            <li><u><i>Potion of Haste</i></u> - A yellow liquid with quick moving forms of white that jet around the vial</li>
            <li><u><i>A Vial of Ooze</i></u> - A thick tar like substance, that obeys its owner, on a bonus action it can be commanded to attack something or someone and it will become rough terrain where they stand.</li> 
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The party took the ooze and the haste potion, in exchange for 2 vials of blood from Viktor (Mal was told they were from a long dead creature, he believed them as he couldnt tell what their origin was and Viktor made a skull appear in the one he was looking at) and for an ancient Elvish arrow, that works the same as Yondu. Kira also put forward a kiss from Viktor to seal the deal, which Mal was excited about and Viktor obliged, making Mal blush quite a lot. After this they headed further in and Kira seeing the large and only tree in the city standing behind a large table on a stage, she went over and meditated with it, a twisted huge tree with pink blossoms covering it. Lilith then headed to the bar and had a few pints, each of the beers themed after the 5 dwarven houses. Druinins beer being a red ale that turns to orange at the top, with a large foamy head, very strong, Kira joined her and got very drunk. After this they headed back to the Hammer Head, where they got 5 beds for 5 silver, as they entered the tavern they had to hand their weapons to the two stone golem dwarves at the door, after a pint and briefly talking to the bartender they made their way to bed to rest for the evening. As night fell all was quiet. </p>
    <p>Until something awoke Val and Lilith, looking out their windows into the night seeing what stirred them the night was still, a dark blue sky filled the horizon and the moon hung low in the sky. Val looking out say a great creature flying across the sky, seeing a flash of red as the moon glinted off its back. Lilith looking around saw a large 70ft wingspan green dragon fly over the top of the hammer head and out of sight, deathly quiet. Leaving her room she went to the bar for a pint to calm herself, Val instead went and woke Monty. After knocking on doors the rest of the party woke up as well as Viktor accidently waking up Mal, after trying and failing to hide from it, Monty turned round in her room to see the large yellow eye staring through Mals window across the hall at her, as a reaction she spun and instinctively threw her axe at it, with a nat 20 causing a scar on the eye to the left of the iris. As it reeled back it, Monty ran from the room, the dragon said, "This is going to be fun" before letting out a torent of white hot dragon fire into the rooms, the party, thorin oakenshield style survived the blast and managed to stay clear of harm. And the session ended there. </p>
